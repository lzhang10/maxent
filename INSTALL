Compiling and installing maxent package
=======================================

NOTICE: This file only covers building the package under unix environment.
Readers from Win32 platform should consult the PDF manual in doc/manual.pdf
for instructions on building with various Win32 compilers.

Now go on:

The following build dependancies are required:
 * Jam (included) (http://www.perforce.com/)
 * Boost C++ library (subset of v1.48 included) (http://www.boost.org)
 * zlib library and headers (optional)
 * a fortran compiler (optional but highly recommended)

The boost lib shipped with this package is a subset of the full boost lib. If
you encounter building errors then please download the latest boost lib and 
try again.

You need to have a working Fortran compiler in order to take advantage of
LBFGS code. On OS X you can get gfortran installed using Homebrew:

$ brew install gfortran

All building commands must be executed from the top-level source directory. To 
configure the toolkit, just type:

$ ./configure

(NOTE: the leading '$' character is used to represent a shell prompt.  DO NOT
actually type that in!) This will run the `configure' script which will try to
figure out the configuration of your compilers automatically.

Now you can build the package by calling:

$ make

Which will build the optimized library and command line tool "maxent".

    Optionally, you can build some unittest:
    $ make unittest

    If no error occurs, go to test/ directory and run all the test:
    $ cd test
    $ python runall.py

    All tests should pass without error except test_event, which may abort. (If
    you find an error, please write to me.)

To install the executable file and the lib you can type (as root):

# make install

To clean the build, type:

$ make clean

More details are covered in the PDF manual.

Please consult python/README for instruction on building the python extension
module.
