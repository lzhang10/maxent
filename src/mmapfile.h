 * mmapfile.h  -  A platform independent mmap wrapper
 *
 * Copyright (C) 2004 by Le Zhang <ejoy@users.sourceforge.net>
 * Begin       : 29-May-2004
 * Last Change : 22-May-2005.
 * 
 * USEAGE:
 *   if mmap support is identified on the system on which this file is compiled,
 *   a macro HAVE_SYSTEM_MMAP will be defined. Then you can write your mmap
 *   supporting code like:
 *
 *   #if defined (HAVE_SYSTEM_MMAP)
 *      int rc;
 *      mmap_info mi;
 *      rc = mmap_open(&mi, file, mode, flags); // create a file mapping
 *      if (rc)
 *          ...  // mmap failed
 *      ...
 *
 *      `mi.addr' now points to the mapped address of the whole file
 *      `mi.size' is the size of the mmapped memory in bytes
 *      ...
 *
 *      rc = mmap_close(&mi);  // close the file mapping
 *      if (rc)
 *          ...  // unmmap failed
 *   #endif
 *
 *   Currently only mapping with shared reading is implemented. Do not attempt to
 *   write to the mapped address `addr'. The code should work on both unix
 *   platform that supports mmap(2) call or Win32 platform (mingw & cygwin). 
 *
 *   This file should work out of the box on Linux/FreeBSD/Win32. However on
 *   system unknown to the file, you may want to use autoconf macro
 *   AC_FUNC_MMAP to check the existence of working mmap(2) first. Otherwise
 *   these routines will not be available.
 *
 *   A C++ wrapper class is provided in `mmapfile.hpp'.
