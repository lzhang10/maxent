# Python Extension for maxent

This directory contains source codes for building the Python3 extension of the C++
library. More detail instructions can be found in [INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md#python-extension).

The python binding code is generated with SWIG (http://www.swig.org). The
wrapper code is tuned by hand in order to be as efficient as possible.
